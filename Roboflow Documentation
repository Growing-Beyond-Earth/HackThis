Roboflow Object Detection

Roboflow is an online service that provides users with the software to create bounding boxes for object detection algorithms. In addition, Roboflow also
provides an in-house training function, where they will train your model without the need of coding yourself. We have used Roboflow in order to create a
dataset for our Leaf Detection model, and to train one of the first versions of the model itself.

Note: This is a link to the public version of the database. To get full access, you must be added as an administrator. Currently, all of the 2022 interns,
as well as Dr. Lewis have been added. To be added, ask one of the current administrators for help -- all of the 2022 interns are more than happy to provide
assistance with the software whenever someone may need it.
