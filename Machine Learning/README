YOLOv5 is an object detection algorithm created by Glenn Jocher in 2020. We used YOLOv5 to train our leaf detection model. After two attempts, we created
a model that accurately detects where the leaves are approximately 90% of the time. The code for the YOLOv5 model was not our own; we altered Roboflow-
provided code to fit our own dataset. Specific documentation for YOLOv5 is widely available online. For more details on how we specifically used our
model, please watch our presentation, the link to which is attached below.


Attached is a link to the Google Collab file we used to create our YOLOv5 leaf detection model:

Feel free to make a copy of this file to create edits, however this code must be altered to function outside of Google Collab, because parts of it are 
specific to filepaths found on Eugene's computer.
